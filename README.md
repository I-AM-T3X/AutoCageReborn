# AutoCageReborn
**Auto Cage Reborn** is a modernized continuation of [AutoCage](https://github.com/Kruithne/AutoCage) by [@Kruithne](https://github.com/Kruithne), updated for current World of Warcraft retail clients with full localization support, throttled operations to prevent server spam, and preserved journal filters. This lightweight addon automatically detects and cages duplicate level 1 battle pets that aren't favorited—either instantly when learned via the optional auto-cage feature, or manually through a convenient "Cage Duplicate Pets" button added to the Pet Journal.

All credit for the original concept and implementation belongs to Kruithne (kruithne@gmail.com). This derivative work maintains compatibility with the original vision while incorporating modern API improvements such as `C_Timer` usage, proper namespace protection, and support for eleven languages.
